    <h1>Simple Graph</h1>
    <p>
        A simple graph is a graph that does not contain more than one edge between the pair of vertices. 
        If each pair of nodes or vertices in a graph <b>G=(V, E)</b> has only one edge, it is a simple graph.
        As a result, there is just one edge linking two vertices, depicting one-to-one interactions between two elements.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are four vertices here labeled B, C, E, F. Each vertex appears to be connected to others with straight edges.
        It is a simple graph because it does not contain any self-loops (edges connecting a vertex to itself) or multiple edges between any two vertices.
    </p>

    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <div class="applications">
        <ul>
            <li><b>Social Networks</b>: Represent friendships, where each edge signifies a connection without self-loops or multiple edges.</li>
            <li><b>Transportation Networks</b>: Cities or stations as nodes connected by edges that represent direct paths without redundant links.</li>
        </ul>
