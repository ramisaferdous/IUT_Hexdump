    <h1>What is a Graph?</h1>
    <p>
        A graph is a non-linear kind of data structure made up of nodes or vertices and edges. The edges connect any two nodes in the graph, and the nodes are also known as vertices.
        We can also define a graph <b>G</b> as an ordered set (V, E), where <b>V(G)</b> represents the set of vertices and <b>E(G)</b> represents the edges that connect these vertices.
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>The above figure shows a graph with:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>V(G) = {A, B, C, D, E}</b></li>
        <li><b>E(G) = {(A, B), (B, C), (A, D), (B, D), (D, E), (C, E)}</b></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Note that there are <b>five vertices</b> or nodes and <b>six edges</b> in the graph.</p>

    <h2>Adjacent Nodes or Neighbours</h2>
    <p>
        For every edge, e = (u, v) that connects nodes u and v, the nodes u and v are the end-points and are said to be the adjacent nodes or neighbours.
    </p>

    <h2>Degree of a Node</h2>
    <p>
        The degree of a node <b>u</b>, denoted as deg(u), is the total number of edges containing the node u. If deg(u) = 0, it means that u does not belong to any edge, and such a node is known as an isolated node.
    </p>
    <p>
        The indegree of a node is the number of arriving edges to a node. The outdegree of a node is the number of departing edges from a node.

    <h2>Path</h2>
    <p>
        A path of length ‘n’ from node ‘u’ to node ‘v’ is defined as a sequence of n+1 nodes.
        <br>
        <div class="font-color"><b>P(u, v) = (v<sub>0</sub>, v<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>2</sub>, v<sub>3</sub>, ……, v<sub>n</sub>)</b></div>
    </p>

    <h2>Closed Path</h2>
    <p>
        A path P is known as a closed path if the edge has the same end-points. That is, if v<sub>0</sub> = v<sub>n</sub>.
    </p>

    <h2>Simple Path</h2>
    <p>
        A path P is known as a simple path if all the nodes in the path are distinct, with an exception that v<sub>0</sub> may be equal to v<sub>n</sub>. If v<sub>0</sub> = v<sub>n</sub>, then the path is called a closed simple path.
    </p>

    <h2>Cycle</h2>
    <p>
        A path in which the first and the last vertices are the same. A simple cycle has no repeated edges or vertices (except the first and last vertices).
